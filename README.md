# Resume

I wrote my resume in HTML because it gives me more freedom and control then MS Word or Google Docs. I threw it up here just in case anyone is interested, and so I can have a central definitive version backed up online. I usually print it to a PDF, but it looks okay as a page.

## PDF

To generate a PDF I use _Microsoft Print to PDF_ with no margins. It's not a very elegant solution, I know, but it works.
